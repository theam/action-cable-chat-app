##Â Benchmarking Action Cable

1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/anycable/websocket-bench. You'll need `Go lang` installed.
2. `cd` to the repo root folder. `cd websocket-bench`
3. `go build .`
4. `go run .`. This is the `websocket-bench` software. I tried installing it by `go install .` but it doesn't seem to be working.
